This app is heavily inspired by [freeCodeCamp - Recipe App using React Router](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvfeBLMA_Q4)

This app utilises https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com to enables cross-origin requests to anywhere (one trick introduced in [freeCodeCamp - Recipe App using React Router](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvfeBLMA_Q4))

This project was powered by react, react-router and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
